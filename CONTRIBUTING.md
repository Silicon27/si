## Layout of Si 
All code for Si is located in the [`include/`](include) directory. There are no source files, only headers. Each header file should contain a single implementation of a data structure or algorithm.

Si headers are organized as a header file with includes, which can be found in the [`include/si/`](include/si) directory. Each Si header should have its own header file, and the file name should match the Si header name.
